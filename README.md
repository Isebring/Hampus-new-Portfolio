# Hampus Isebring's updated portfolio

I decided to recreate my portfolio with the new knowledge I've learned during my coding journey. In this project I mainly used React, TypeScript and Mantine. The major difference from my previous portfolio is that instead of having everything in one page with scrolling, I decided to create routes and different links. These include:

## Home

The Landing page, a brief presentation of me. The rest of the page includes a timeline of my journey in IT and my goal with this career. I also added a quote I like and contact information.

#

## Profile

In this section I wanted to do something simple to showcase what tools I have worked with in coding, but also to show and present some of my many hobbies.

On the profile page I also wanted to showcase some pictures from my life, in order to give the visitor an insight of what matters to me. KlÃ¤ssbol, which I show in two of the images, is a place that has been a part of my family for generations. To me and all my relatives, it is a place to visit for recovery and relief from the daily stresses of life. Take some time to just reflect and spend time together.

#

## CV

Here I simply wanted to present my CV as a PDF directly on the webpage. I also wanted the visitor to be able to download it easily if interested hence I implemented an iframe and a download button.

#

## Skills

I wanted to present my skills in an easy way. I decided to use cards with a title, description and labels to without too much explanation show how I usually approach.

#

## Portfolio

The way I present my projects is actually very similar to my last portfolio. This is because I liked that way of using images, hover effect, text and icons to briefly explain what I did at the same time as presenting relevant links to deep diver into the projects.

This is a work in progress and will most likely be updated from time to time. Thanks for checking it out.
